        My name is Thomas Renner and I am a senior at Oakland University,
        majoring in Computer Science. I am originally from Germany, so german is
        my first language. I learned to program in high school and enjoyed it
        ever since. I have held multiple internships throughout the years,
        starting in IT, and moving on to a Software Engineering position, and
        lastly, obtaining a System Integration Internship. As an Eagle Scout, I
        have had the privilege to collaborate with and lead a multitude of
        people with vastly different backgrounds. There, I was able to
        demonstrate my ability to motivate and to find creative solutions to
        difficult problems. Having written multiple complex programs, that
        revolve around everyday needs, individually and with a team, I have been
        able to continuously prove these skills in my coding and managing of
        groups. To get to know more about me, visit my
        <a href="./html/my_resume.html">Resume</a> and
        <a href="./html/my_fun_facts.html">Fun Facts</a> pages.
